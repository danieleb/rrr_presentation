* What is wrong with research results?
** Many results in digital music are not reproducible 		    :B_block:

   :END:
- 82% of research develop software
  - 39% of those took steps to make their code reproducible
    - 35% of those published their code
- *11%* of researchers published reproducible research code

** The validity of unreproducible research can be questionable	    :B_block:

   :END:
- Lack of statistical rigor can lead to misleading results: /fooled by randomness/
- Lack of career incentives can lead to publication bias: /only positive results appear in journals/

The Reproducible Research Repository lowers the barriers for reproducible research by enabling sharing of resources and workflows

* The reproducible research repository
- Organised around *experiments*: self-contained units corresponding to figures and tables present in academic publications
- Each experiment is linked to a number of *resources* 
  - Datasets
  - Software
  - Publications
- Each experiment contains *instructions* on how to reproduce results, including
  - Software versions and parameters
  - Description of workflows

* Reproducible research is reproducible

- RRR has been designed using Drupal, the biblio module and various other customizations
